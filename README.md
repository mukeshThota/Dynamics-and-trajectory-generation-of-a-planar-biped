# Dynamics-and-trajectory-generation-of-a-planar-biped
This project is aimed at controlling the dynamics of a biped and generating the trajectory of a bipedal gait.Developed the dynamics of a planar biped,using lagrangian mechanics by assuming it to be a 4 linked open chain,developed a matlab algorithm for the torque input to the matlab simulink model and generated the trajectory of the leg using joint angles as the parameters and considering foot as the end effector of the planar chain.
